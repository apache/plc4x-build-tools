== Preparing your Computer

Building a project like Apache PLC4X on multiple target operating-systems is quite a challenge, but I think we managed to make it as simple as possible.

However when building any of the parts of PLC4X there are some requirements the build is expecting you to have provided.

In order to build at all you are required to have `Java 8` installed on your machine.
We have tested the build with Java 8 up to Java 13.
If a new version comes out, please give us a little time to handle any related issues, but we'll probably fix them as soon as possible.
However in the past with Oracle's new release strategy, there have been a few bumps on the road.

If you get any successful output, you probably don't need to do anything.

Apt-based systems:

 sudo apt-get install git

Yum based systems:

 sudo yum install git

==== LibPCAP

Apt-based systems:

 sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev

Microsoft has documented what is needed to install `.Net SDK` https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/linux-package-manager/rhel/sdk-2.2.203[here]

For Ubuntu this would be:

 wget -q https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/16.04/packages-microsoft-prod.deb
 sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb

 sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install dotnet-sdk-2.2

For other distributions, please select the distribution in the drop-down menu and follow the instructions there.

==== python

Checking:

 python --version

If you get a version of 2.7 or higher reported, you probably don't need to do anything.

Apt-based systems:

 sudo apt-get install python-dev

Yum based systems:

 yum install gcc
 cd /usr/src
 wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.10/Python-2.7.10.tgz
 tar xzf Python-2.7.10.tgz
 cd Python-2.7.10
 ./configure
 make altinstall

==== bison

Checking:

 bison --version

If you get a version above 2.3 output, you don't need to do anything.

Apt-based systems:

 sudo apt-get install bison

Yum based systems:

 sudo yum install bison-devel

==== flex

Checking:

 flex --version

If you get any successful output, you probably don't need to do anything.

Apt-based systems:

 sudo apt-get install flex

Yum based systems:

 sudo yum install flex

=== macOS

Most libraries on Mac are installed using `Homebrew`.

Make sure `Homebrew` ist installed in order to install most of these.

    /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

==== Git

Checking:

 git --version

If you get any successful output, you probably don't need to do anything.

In order to install it, please execute the following command:

 brew install git

==== LibPCAP

==== gcc

Checking:

 gcc --version

If you get any successful output, you probably don't need to do anything.

It seems macOS comes with a version of gcc which is good enough for our usecases.

==== g++

Checking:

 g++ --version

If you get any successful output, you probably don't need to do anything.

It seems macOS comes with a version of g++ which is good enough for our usecases.

==== dotnet

Checking:

 dotnet --version

If you get any successful output, you probably don't need to do anything.

Microsoft is offering an installer for MacOS which is available from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2[here].

==== python

Checking:

 python --version

If you get a version of 2.7 or higher reported, you probably don't need to do anything.

In order to install it, please execute the following command:

 brew install python@2

==== bison

Checking:

 python --version

If you get a version above 2.3 output, you don't need to do anything.

macOS comes with a pre-installed version of bison, however this version is 2.3 and hereby too old.
So you need to update to a more recent version:

 brew install bison
 brew link bison --force
 echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/bison/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

Be sure to reboot or at least restart your IDE or commandline in order for the changes to become effective.

==== flex

Checking:

 flex --version

If you get any successful output, you probably don't need to do anything.

It seems macOS comes with a version of flex which is good enough for our usecases.

=== Windows

==== Git

Checking:

 git --version

If you get any successful output, you probably don't need to do anything.

In order to install it, please download end execute the installer from https://git-scm.com/download/win[here] and make sure to have it add the git executable to your systems `PATH`.

==== LibPCAP

A special version of LibPCAP is available for Windows, which is called Npcap.
It is available from https://npcap.com/[here].

So in order to install things correctly:

1. install the version Npcap from above location.
2. Add `%SystemRoot%\System32\Npcap\` to your System's `PATH`
3. Possibly reboot

After this all should be working.

NOTE: If you had WinPcap installed, you need to uninstall this and make sure the files `Packet.dll` and `wpcap.dll` are deleted in the `%SystemRoot%\System32\` directory. Otherwise `pcap4j` will incorrectly detect a wrong version.

==== gcc

Checking:

 gcc --version

If you get any successful output, you probably don't need to do anything.

On windows we will be using something called WinBuilds, which is sort of a package consisting of a typical build environment consisting of multiple build tools. So please look at the WinBuilds chapter at the end of the Windows section.

==== g++

Checking:

 g++ --version

If you get any successful output, you probably don't need to do anything.

On windows we will be using something called WinBuilds, which is sort of a package consisting of a typical build environment consisting of multiple build tools. So please look at the WinBuilds chapter at the end of the Windows section.

==== dotnet

Checking:

 dotnet --version

If you get any successful output, you probably don't need to do anything.

Usually this is already installed on Windows machines.

==== python

Checking:

 python --version

If you get any successful output, you probably don't need to do anything.

You can get Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2716/[here].

Make sure directory containing `python.exe` is added to your systems `PATH`.
Also make sure you restarted your IDE and or console window after changing the `PATH` settings for the changes to take effect.

==== bison

Checking:

 bison --version

If you get any successful output, you probably don't need to do anything.

For Bison, please download the Setup installer version from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/bison.htm[here] (When using the zip version the bison.exe couldn't find some DLL files)
It seems the official 2.4.1 version has issues when installed in a directory which's path contains spaces. Please make sure you replace the exe with a patched version form http://marin.jb.free.fr/bison/bison-2.4.1-modified.zip[here]
(More infos on this issue https://sourceforge.net/p/gnuwin32/bugs/473/[here])

It seems there are issues if these tools are installed in paths with spaces.
So if it is for example installed in the 32 bit `Programs (x86)` directory, the build will probably fail.

Make sure all tools `bin` directories are added to your systems `PATH`.
For tools like OpenSSL be sure to add the directory containing the `openssl.exe` (Usually the root directory).
Also make sure you restarted your IDE and or console window after changing the `PATH` settings for the changes to take effect.

==== flex

Checking:

 flex --version

If you get any successful output, you probably don't need to do anything.

Please download the Flex compiler from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/flex.htm[here] (Ideally download the binary zip distribution)

Make sure it's `bin` directory is added to your systems `PATH`.
Also make sure you restarted your IDE and or console window after changing the `PATH` settings for the changes to take effect.

==== WinBuilds

He have tested WinBuilds with the bundle found http://win-builds.org/doku.php/download_and_installation_from_windows[here].

WARNING: Please use the installer. When using the zip distribution and manually adding that to the `PATH` the build will fail without a log output as some binaries can't find some of the DLL files.

When running the installer, make sure to select the options:
- Native Windows
- x86_64
Not quite sure which elements are really needed, better just install all of them.

Make sure it's `bin` directory is added to your systems `PATH`, however the installer should have taken care of this.
Also make sure you restarted your IDE and or console window after changing the `PATH` settings for the changes to take effect.
