== Getting Started

=== Using the PLC4X API directly

In order to write a valid PLC4X Java application, all you need, is to add a dependency to the `api module`.
When using Maven, all you need to do is add this dependency:

[subs=attributes+]
----
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.apache.plc4x</groupId>
      <artifactId>plc4j-api</artifactId>
      <version>{project-version}</version>
    </dependency>
----

This will allow you to write a valid application, that compiles fine.
However in order to actually connect to a device using a given protocol, you need to add this protocol implementation to the classpath.

For example in order to communicate with an `S7 device` using the `S7 Protocol`, you would need to add the following dependency:

[subs=attributes+]
----
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.apache.plc4x</groupId>
      <artifactId>plc4j-driver-s7</artifactId>
      <version>{project-version}</version>
      <scope>runtime</scope>
    </dependency>
----

So as soon as your project has the API and a driver implementation available, you first need to get a `PlcConnection` instance.
This is done via the `PlcDriverManager` by asking this to create an instance for a given `PLC4X connection string`.

----
String connectionString = "s7://10.10.64.20/1/1";

try (PlcConnection plcConnection = new PlcDriverManager().getConnection(connectionString)) {

  ... do something with the connection here ...

}
----

PLC4X generally supports a very limited set of functions, which is not due to the fact, that we didn't implement things, but that PLCs generally support a very limited set of functions.

The basic functions supported by PLCs and therefore supported by PLC4X are:

* Read data
* Write data
* Subscribe for data
* Execute functions in the PLC
* List resources in the PLC

In general we will try to offer as many features as possible.
So if a protocol doesn't support subscription based communication it is our goal to simulate this by polling in the background so it is transparent for the users.

But there are some cases in which we can't simulate or features are simply disabled intentionally:

* If a PLC and/or protocol don't support executing of functions, we simply can't provide this functionality.
* We will be providing stripped down versions of drivers, that for example intentionally don't support any writing of data and executing of functions.

Therefore we use metadata to check programmatically, if a given feature is available:

----
// Check if this connection support reading of data.
if (!plcConnection.getMetadata().canRead()) {
  logger.error("This connection doesn't support reading.");
  return;
}
----

As soon as you have ensured that a feature is available, you are ready to build a first request.
This is done by getting a `PlcRequestBuilder`:

----
// Create a new read request:
// - Give the single item requested the alias name "value"
PlcReadRequest.Builder builder = plcConnection.readRequestBuilder();
builder.addItem("value-1", "%Q0.4:BOOL");
builder.addItem("value-2", "%Q0:BYTE");
builder.addItem("value-3", "%I0.2:BOOL");
builder.addItem("value-4", "%DB.DB1.4:INT");
PlcReadRequest readRequest = builder.build();
----


So, as you can see, you prepare a request, by adding items to the request and in the end by calling the `build` method.

The request is sent to the PLC by issuing the `execute` method on the request object:

----
CompletableFuture<? extends PlcReadResponse> asyncResponse = readRequest.execute();
asyncResponse.whenComplete((response, throwable) -> {
  ... process the response ...
});
----

In general all requests are executed asynchronously.
So as soon as the request is fully processed, the callback gets called and will contain a `readResponse`, if everything went right or a `throwable` if there were problems.

However if you want to write your code in a more synchronous fashion, the following alternative will provide this:

----
PlcReadResponse response = readRequest.execute().get();
----

Processing of the responses is identical in both cases.
The following example will demonstrate some of the options you have:

----
for (String fieldName : response.getFieldNames()) {
    if(response.getResponseCode(fieldName) == PlcResponseCode.OK) {
        int numValues = response.getNumberOfValues(fieldName);
        // If it's just one element, output just one single line.
        if(numValues == 1) {
            logger.info("Value[" + fieldName + "]: " + response.getObject(fieldName));
        }
        // If it's more than one element, output each in a single row.
        else {
            logger.info("Value[" + fieldName + "]:");
            for(int i = 0; i < numValues; i++) {
                logger.info(" - " + response.getObject(fieldName, i));
            }
        }
    }
    // Something went wrong, to output an error message instead.
    else {
        logger.error("Error[" + fieldName + "]: " + response.getResponseCode(fieldName).name());
    }
}
----

In the for loop, we are demonstrating how the user can iterate over the address aliases in the response.
In case of an ordinary read request, this will be predefined by the items in the request, however in case of a subscription response, the response might only contain some of the items that were subscribed.

Before accessing the data, it is advisable to check if an item was correctly returned.
This is done by the `getResponseCode` method for a given alias.
If this is `PlcResponseCode.OK`, everything is ok, however it could be one of the following:

- NOT_FOUND
- ACCESS_DENIED
- INVALID_ADDRESS
- INVALID_DATATYPE
- INTERNAL_ERROR
- RESPONSE_PENDING

Assuming the return code was `OK`, we can continue accessing the data.

As some addresses support reading arrays, with the method `getNumberOfValues` the user can check how many items of a given type are returned.
For convenience the response object has single-argument methods for accessing the data, which default to returning the first element.

    response.getObject(fieldName)

If you want to access a given element number, please use the two-argument version instead:

    response.getObject(fieldName, 42)

PLC4X provides getters and setters for a wide variety of Java types and automatically handles the type conversion.
However when for example trying to get a long-value as a byte and the long-value exceeds the range supported by the smaller type, a `RuntimeException` of type `PlcIncompatibleDatatypeException`.
In order to avoid causing this exception to be thrown, however there are `isValid{TypeName}` methods that you can use to check if the value is compatible.
