=== Using the PLC4X API directly

In order to write a valid PLC4X Java application, all you need, is to add a dependency to the `api module`.
When using Maven, all you need to do is add this dependency:

[subs=attributes+]
----
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.apache.plc4x</groupId>
      <artifactId>plc4j-api</artifactId>
      <version>{project-version}</version>
    </dependency>
----

This will allow you to write a valid application, that compiles fine.
However in order to actually connect to a device using a given protocol, you need to add this protocol implementation to the classpath.

If this line is empty, the output is skipped for this instance.

=== Example `Java` output

....
package org.apache.plc4x.language.java;

import freemarker.template.*;
import org.apache.plc4x.plugins.codegenerator.protocol.freemarker.FreemarkerLanguageOutput;
import org.apache.plc4x.plugins.codegenerator.protocol.freemarker.FreemarkerLanguageTemplateHelper;
import org.apache.plc4x.plugins.codegenerator.types.definitions.ComplexTypeDefinition;

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class JavaLanguageOutput extends FreemarkerLanguageOutput {

    @Override
    public String getName() {
        return "Java";
    }

    protected List<Template> getTemplates(Configuration freemarkerConfiguration) throws IOException {
        return Arrays.asList(
            freemarkerConfiguration.getTemplate("templates/java/pojo-template.ftlh"),
            freemarkerConfiguration.getTemplate("templates/java/io-template.ftlh"));
    }

    protected FreemarkerLanguageTemplateHelper getHelper(Map<String, ComplexTypeDefinition> types) {
        return new JavaLanguageTemplateHelper(types);
    }

}

=== Options to communicating with PLCs

In general there are two options for communicating with industrial PLCs:

* Using a protocol converter
** Hardware protocol converter
** Software protocol converter
* Using a driver for direct communication
** Commercial drivers
** Open-Source drivers

Well protocol converters are all software in the end, but while a "hardware converter" is usually a closed hardware box that runs some sort of software, a "software converter" is usually an installable service or program that runs on a host system.

== Example: DF1 MSpec

The DF1 protocol has three basic messages: a command message, acknowledge and not acknowledge.
A `0x10` is used as delimiter to differentiate between the messages and parts of the command message.

[width="25%",cols="^,^"]
|============
|ACK | NAK

|10 06 |10 15
|============

This is what a read command message looks like in full-duplex mode using CRC as checksum:
[cols="^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^"]
|===
|Name | DLE | STX | DST | SRC | CMD | STS | TNS | ADDR | SIZE | DLE | ETX | CRC

|Value | 10 | 02 | XX | XX | 01 | 00 | XX XX | XX XX | 02 | 10 | 03 | XX XX
|===

The according response with the requested byte data:
[cols="^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^"]
|===
|Name | DLE | STX | DST | SRC | CMD | STS | TNS | DATA | SIZE | DLE | ETX | CRC

|Value | 10 | 02 | XX | XX | 41 | 00 | XX XX | XX XX | 02 | 10 | 03 | XX XX
|===

== Code Generation

As hand-writing code for a lot of drivers in multiple languages would be quite a nightmare, we have invested a very large amount of time into finding a way to automate this.

So in the end we need 3 parts:

1. Protocol definition
2. Language template
3. A maven plugin which generates the code

This maven plugin uses a given protocol definition as well as a language template and generates code for reading/writing data in that protocol with the given language.

=== Building the PLC4X Website with Maven

The PLC4X Website is also part of the same GIT repository that contains the code and it is built by Maven as well.

In order to build the website the following command should be sufficient:

    mvn site

However this will generate the website for each module inside it's `target/site` directory.
Opening this in a browser and navigating from pages of one module to another will not work as these links expect a different directory structure.
In order to create a fully navigatable version of the Website, the following command should be sufficient:

    mvn site site:stage

This will generate an additional `target/staging` directory which contains the fully functional version.

A lot of documentation on Maven suggests to use the `site:site` goal directly instead of calling the `site` phase, but in case of PLC4X there is more than just the site generation that has to be executed.

This is just a quick-start version of the site generation, for a fully detailed documentation please read the http://plc4x.apache.org/developers/website.html[Website] documentation page.
